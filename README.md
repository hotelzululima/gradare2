Gradare2
========

This is a port of the simple gradare UI based on GTK+ and VTE, providing
a set of helpful utilities on top of a text terminal to interact with r2.

The original program was written for radare1 and it's included inside the
gui/ directory of the https://github.com/radare/radare repository.

This project aims to bring an updated version for radare2
